# Structured Outputs by Example

> Structured Outputs by Example is a hands-on introduction to working with structured data extraction from LLMs. The site showcases how to use libraries like [Instructor](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor) and [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) to reliably extract structured information from LLM outputs.

Examples here assume Python `>=3.9` and the latest versions of Instructor and Pydantic. Try to upgrade to the latest versions if something isn't working.

Note: A more comprehensive version of this file / documentation is available at llms-ctx.txt, which contains the full text of all examples including code samples and terminal output. You could paste that into your IDE or AI model to then ask questions and get it to generate code with the examples as context.

## Getting Started

- Getting Started with Structured Outputs: Learn the basics of structured LLM outputs with Instructor.
- Installing Instructor
- Your First Extraction
- Understanding Response Models
- Client Setup

## LLM Providers

- OpenAI Integration
- Anthropic Integration
- Gemini Integration
- Cohere Integration

## Basic Extraction Patterns

- Simple Object Extraction: Here we extract basic objects from text with Instructor.
- List Extraction: You are also able to extract lists of objects from text with Instructor..
- Simple Nested Structure: This example shows how to work with nested objects in Instructor..
- Field Validation
- Optional Fields: This example demonstrates how to handle optional or missing data in structured extractions: 1.
- Effective Prompt Templating with Jinja and Pydantic: Learn to dynamically create prompts using Jinja templating and validate them with Pydantic.

## Classification and Analysis

- Simple Classification: Perform single-label classification with Instructor and structured outputs..
- Multi-label Classification: This example demonstrates various approaches to multi-label classification using Instructor: 1.
